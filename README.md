# Memory Leak Detecter

Supprots only Windows 10, may work unstable on other versions.
 
This program will notify you if any launched process has memory leak.
If process ram usage is increasing linearly then Detecter will send you **Windows Notification**.
If available ram on your pc will be less than some mb, then **Detecter will kill** the most fat process.

That's easy :D
